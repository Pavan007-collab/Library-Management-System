A Library Management System (LMS) is a software application designed to manage the operations of a library. It helps in organizing and managing library resources like books, journals, and digital media, making it easier for both the library staff and users to track and manage items efficiently. An LMS can be used for managing physical books as well as e-books and other digital materials.
